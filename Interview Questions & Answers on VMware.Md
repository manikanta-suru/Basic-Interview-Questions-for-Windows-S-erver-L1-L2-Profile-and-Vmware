### VMware vMotion

**Definition:**
- vMotion is a feature in VMware that allows for moving running virtual machines (VMs) from one ESX host to another ESX host without downtime.

**How It Works:**
- vMotion works by copying the memory bitmap from the source host to the destination host.

**Reasons to Use vMotion:**
1. **Host Maintenance:**
   - For updating ESX host updates.
   - Increasing service console memory up to 800 MB.
   - Adding hardware like memory, CPU, disk, and NIC.
   - All these operations require the ESX host to reboot, thus placing the host in maintenance mode is necessary.
   
2. **Continuous VM Operations:**
   - In scenarios where VMs lack sufficient resources, moving VMs ensures continuous operations.

3. **Better Hardware Utilization:**
   - When ESX hosts are running out of resources, moving VMs ensures better hardware utilization.

**Conditions for vMotion:**
- CPU Compatibility: CPUs should be from the same family (either Intel or AMD).
- Common or Shared Storage.
- Available resources on the destination host.
- Same physical network.
- Create VMkernel port groups on both source and destination hosts.
- No access to mountable devices (e.g., CD, floppy).
- No permission to the VMX file.

### VMware Storage vMotion (svMotion)

**Definition:**
- svMotion allows for moving running virtual machine disk files from one shared storage to another shared storage.

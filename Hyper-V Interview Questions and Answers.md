### Hyper-V Interview Questions and Answers

#### **1. What is Hyper-V?**

**Answer:** 
Hyper-V is a virtualization technology from Microsoft that allows you to create and manage virtual machines on a physical host server. It enables multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical machine by abstracting hardware resources.

#### **2. What are the key features of Hyper-V?**

**Answer:** 
- **Virtual Machine Isolation:** Each VM runs in isolation from others.
- **Live Migration:** Move running VMs between hosts without downtime.
- **Snapshot:** Take snapshots of VMs to capture their state at a point in time.
- **Dynamic Memory:** Automatically adjusts the amount of memory allocated to a VM based on its needs.
- **Virtual Switches:** Provide network connectivity to VMs.
- **Resource Metering:** Monitor resource usage for VMs.

#### **3. How do you enable Hyper-V on a Windows Server?**

**Answer:** 
1. Open **Server Manager**.
2. Click on **Add Roles and Features**.
3. Follow the wizard and select **Hyper-V** from the list of roles.
4. Select the network adapters to be used for the virtual switch.
5. Complete the installation and restart the server if prompted.

#### **4. What is Live Migration in Hyper-V?**

**Answer:** 
Live Migration is a feature that allows you to move a running virtual machine from one physical host to another without any downtime. It ensures continuous availability of the VM during the migration process.

#### **5. What is the difference between Generation 1 and Generation 2 VMs in Hyper-V?**

**Answer:**
- **Generation 1 VMs:** Support legacy BIOS, IDE controllers, and other older hardware emulation. They are compatible with older operating systems.
- **Generation 2 VMs:** Use UEFI, support Secure Boot, and offer better performance and security features. They are compatible with modern operating systems.

#### **6. What is Hyper-V Manager?**

**Answer:** 
Hyper-V Manager is a graphical user interface tool that allows administrators to create, configure, and manage virtual machines and virtual networks on Hyper-V hosts. It provides a centralized interface for managing Hyper-V environments.

#### **7. How do you create a virtual machine in Hyper-V Manager?**

**Answer:** 
1. Open **Hyper-V Manager**.
2. Right-click on the Hyper-V host and select **New** > **Virtual Machine**.
3. Follow the wizard to specify the name, generation, memory, networking, and storage settings for the new VM.
4. Complete the wizard and start the virtual machine.

#### **8. What is Dynamic Memory in Hyper-V?**

**Answer:** 
Dynamic Memory is a feature that allows Hyper-V to automatically adjust the amount of memory allocated to a virtual machine based on its current needs. This helps optimize memory usage and ensures efficient allocation of resources.

#### **9. What are Hyper-V Integration Services?**

**Answer:** 
Hyper-V Integration Services are a set of drivers and services installed on guest operating systems to improve performance and enable communication between the host and the guest. They include features like time synchronization, data exchange, and heartbeat.

#### **10. What is a Hyper-V Replica?**

**Answer:** 
Hyper-V Replica is a disaster recovery feature that asynchronously replicates virtual machines from a primary site to a secondary site. In case of a failure at the primary site, the replicated VMs can be brought online at the secondary site with minimal downtime.

#### **11. How do you enable and configure Hyper-V Replica?**

**Answer:**
1. Open **Hyper-V Manager** on both primary and secondary hosts.
2. Right-click the Hyper-V host and select **Hyper-V Settings**.
3. Enable **Replication Configuration** and configure authentication and network settings.
4. Right-click the VM you want to replicate and select **Enable Replication**.
5. Follow the wizard to specify the secondary host, authentication settings, and replication frequency.

#### **12. What is the difference between a checkpoint and a snapshot in Hyper-V?**

**Answer:**
There is no difference; the term "checkpoint" is now used in place of "snapshot" in Hyper-V. A checkpoint captures the state, data, and configuration of a VM at a specific point in time, allowing you to revert to that state if needed.

#### **13. What is the Hyper-V Virtual Switch?**

**Answer:** 
The Hyper-V Virtual Switch is a software-based layer-2 network switch that provides network connectivity to virtual machines. It allows VMs to communicate with each other, the host, and external networks.

#### **14. How do you create a virtual switch in Hyper-V Manager?**

**Answer:**
1. Open **Hyper-V Manager**.
2. Click on the host and select **Virtual Switch Manager**.
3. Choose the type of virtual switch (External, Internal, or Private) and click **Create Virtual Switch**.
4. Configure the switch settings and click **OK** to save.

#### **15. What is Nested Virtualization in Hyper-V?**

**Answer:**
Nested Virtualization is a feature that allows you to run a Hyper-V virtual machine inside another Hyper-V virtual machine. This is useful for testing and development scenarios where you need to simulate a Hyper-V environment within a VM.
